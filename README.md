# East Coast - SF Microbial Analyses

### 16S rRNA gene data analysis of sediment samples from Delaware River Estuary (PA), Alligator River Estuary (NC), Waccamaw River Estuary (SC) and San Francisco Bay Estuary (CA).
### Data collected from multiple field samples, field experiments, laboratory microcosms
### Overall goals are to understand how microbial ecology contributes to methane emissions across salinity gradients
### Collaboration with Emily Bernhardt, Marcelo Ard√≥n, Scott Neubauer, Nat Weston
### Exploratory figures in "Figs" folder
